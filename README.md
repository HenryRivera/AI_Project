A* Search Algorithm Implementation to Solve 15 Puzzle Problem


In order to run my project simply call main and pass in the name of the file that contains the initial and goal states. 
In order for my code to work the naming convention of files passed in must follow the following convention: Input + # + .txt. 
This is just like the test input files we were given, i.e. Input1.txt, Input2.txt, Input3.txt, Input4.txt. 
This is because I use the number to automatically generate an output file with the same number.
